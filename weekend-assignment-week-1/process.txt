"L   Z"

How ? 
loops can be used 
count space in-between them 
3 space 

run the loop from the Lion encounter to Zebra encounter 
keep these encounter excluded from counting space.

need to track if we have ecnountered a lion or a zebra 

Now if encountered lion we can count the upcoming
 space based on there is a Lion ready to hunt

 need a way to store the count of steps taken before the hunt 

 it break if there is a space after the hunt (" L   Z " )
 need a way to control this 
 I controlled by scanning for hunt (Z) itself the moment we encounter it we stop

 I stored the  count when two different animal were encountered, but after comparing value of previously stored count and current count 
 if current count was less than previous count then I stored it and in both case wether true or false 
 we reset count to 0 

the outline of this problem 
    " "count white spaces 
    but only if an animal encountered previously
    and reset the count if the same animal that we encountered previously occurrs again 

    if different animal encountered then store if and only if the value is less than previous value
