### Simple odd even program

---

---

- #### I just have to iterate and document everything
- #### atomic stuff will be good
- #### smallest possible change while maintaining functionality
- #### I made a small change now it contradicts with the expected output I need to change and fix or revert back to the previous state
- #### I made a check to see if it works and it does
- #### It breaks for another input so need to change something
- #### odd even has a property divisible by 2 or not decides wether it's an odd or an even number.
- #### By divisible we mean remainder is 0(even) or 1(odd)
- #### we need something that can do this particular operation
- #### so I think we can change the suffix logic
- #### but how can we change in such a way that it works ?
- #### maybe dividing the input will do something that will tell it is even or odd
- #### As we have to break the problem; even odd is in it's fundamental is a division problem
- #### so normal division won't work as it is giving a different thing (not 0 or 1) it's giving quotient
- #### there is an operator modulo % which can do the job I think so
- #### I think this just worked
- #### I'll check multiple cases to see if it works
- #### I need a mechanism that can do this for me something that can loop over
- #### now I will integrate small small fix in my small fix 
- #### if I replace the suffix logic from new to previous one I should get the desired output 
- #### it broke, but the suffix logic was fixed by changing the logic in reverse 
- #### finally it works 
- #### I had this idea and implemented it
